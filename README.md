# TIC-TOC-TOE-GAME
Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.

How to Play

Run the Main class.
The game will display an empty 3x3 board.
Players take turns entering the row and column (0-2) where they want to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
The game checks for a valid move (within board boundaries and empty cell).
If the move is valid, the player's mark is placed on the board.
The game checks if the current player has won.
If a player wins, the game announces the winner and ends.
If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Game Rules

Players alternate turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on the board.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw. Â
